# Causal-inference-predicts-object-and-observer-motion-in-the-world

Imagine you are driving a car. You see stationary objects (such as trees and buildings) and objects that move independently (other cars on the street). In order to navigate to your desired location, you need to know how you are moving, navigate around the objects and drive to our target.

But, the brain does not know apriori how you are moving or how the objects are behaving. It can only infer these metrics from sensory signals. The visual system provides two motion signals: (1) motion of the observer within the environment (i.e., patterns of stationary objects moving on the retina); and (2) motion of objects relative to the observer xobj. 

I propose that the brain implements a decision process, causal inference, to judge how the object and the observer are moving in the world. I develop a Bayesian model to formalize this decision process.
